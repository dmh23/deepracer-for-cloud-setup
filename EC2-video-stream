Stream video of car training on EC2:
* Run `ssh -i "{your pem file name}.pem" -L 8085:localhost:8080 ubuntu@{ec2 ip}.compute-1.amazonaws.com` to ssh into the EC2 instance
* On local machine, navigate to "localhost:8085" in your internet browser
* If you have more than one worker running, you can see the stream for each if you open a new tab (sometimes incognito helps) and navigating to localhost:8085. You may need to refresh a few times to see the other workers.
